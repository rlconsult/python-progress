A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long
running operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.

The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line
is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are many types
of widgets:

 - `Timer`
 - `ETA`
 - `AdaptiveETA`
 - `FileTransferSpeed`
 - `AdaptiveTransferSpeed`
 - `AnimatedMarker`
 - `Counter`
 - `Percentage`
 - `FormatLabel`
 - `SimpleProgress`
 - `Bar`
 - `ReverseBar`
 - `BouncingBar`
 - `RotatingMarker`

The progressbar module is very easy to use, yet very powerful. It will also
automatically enable features like auto-resizing when the system supports it.
